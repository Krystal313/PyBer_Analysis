- Based on the analysis, the summary above has shown the following: 
1. There is a signficiant demand for rides in urban area: 1625 rides and this is 13 times of rural area and 2.6 times of the suburban area. 
2. Given there are only 78 drivers in the rural areas vs. suburban has 490 drivers and urban has 2405 drivers, the average fare per driver in rural area is higher in general due to lack of drivers. However, the difference of average fare between the three city types is relatively close to each other. 
3. With high demands of riders and sufficient number of drivers in urban area, it also has the highest revenue of 39854.38.


## Summary
Some recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types are to increase the driver recruitment in the rural area to meet the mininum demand, which can help to lower the fares. They can also gather riders' demographic information and population in all three cities to better understand the frequent riders and where can they put the resources toward the potential customers: promotions, hiring more drivers, etc.
